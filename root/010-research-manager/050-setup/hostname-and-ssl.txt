long_title: Hostname and SSL certificates
--

Haplo Research Manager is hosted on an address under your institution's domain. This needs to be delegated to the Haplo hosting infrastructure, and SSL certificates provided and renewed throughout the life of the contract.

h3. 1) Choose hostname

Choose a suitable hostname for your application. As you are likely to be using the application for multiple purposes, it's often desirable to use a fairly generic hostname.

For example, if your domain is @example.ac.uk@, most of our customers would choose to host their application on @research.example.ac.uk@.


h3. 2) Delegate hostname in DNS

After you have chosen your hostname, your Haplo contact will provide you with an address on Haplo infrastructure. You should create a @CNAME@ record in your DNS which aliases your chosen hostname to the Haplo address.


h3. 3) Provide SSL certificate

Please review the SSL certificate policy below.

Haplo will generate the private key and provide you with a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Please purchase an SSL certificate using this CSR, and send it back to Haplo using the *Send file* feature of your Project Room.


h3. 4) Set up processes for renewal

Every year Haplo will generate a new private key and send your support contact a new CSR. You'll need to purchase a new SSL certificate before the current certificate expires.

You must obtain a new CSR from Haplo each year. Certificates which are generated using a previous CSR will reuse the private key, and cannot be accepted.


h2. SSL certificate policy

* Haplo *must* generate the private key. We cannot accept SSL certificates where the private key has been generated by the institution or a third party.
* The validity of the certificate should be no more than one year.
* New private keys *must* be generated each time the certificate is renewed.
* Any public CA may be used.
