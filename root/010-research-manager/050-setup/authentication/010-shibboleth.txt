Haplo is a member of a number of Shibboleth federations, and authentication via Shibboleth is our preferred method of authentication. The details of our Service Provider in each federation are listed below.

To allow us to authenticate your users, you must configure your Identity Provider (IdP) to release appropriate claims to the Haplo SP. The identifier required is the unique identifier for each person in the user feed, and is most likely the username, but sometimes institutions use an email address.

After you have set up your IdP, please send an email to your Haplo contact with:

* Which federation you are using.
* Your IdP's entityId.
* The claims you have released.

Provision of a test account will speed up testing and deployment. Please provide details using the secure messaging system provided.
