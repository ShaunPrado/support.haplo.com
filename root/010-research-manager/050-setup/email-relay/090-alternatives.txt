title: Alternatives to email relay
--

While not recommended, we can deliver directly email on your behalf.

This does not generally result in good deliverability, particularly when emailing users outside your institution.

In this case, you should:

* white list our IP address ranges, so any email we send to you bypasses your spam filters. Ask your Haplo contact for the current IP addresses.
* add @include:hosted-spf.haplo-services.com@ to your "SPF records":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework

However, even with these measures, your plan for supporting the service should take into account that email notifications may be unreliable.
