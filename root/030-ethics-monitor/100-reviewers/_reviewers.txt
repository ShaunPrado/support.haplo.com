Reviewers receive a task and email asking them to review applications. Reviewers may be selected because of their role (eg the Supervisor of the applicant) or because of their expertise.

The Reviewer automatically has permission to view the applications and associated files. 

The Reviewer selects the application form on the right of the application record and reads the answers provided by the applicant. 

The Reviewer can add comments inline against each question provided and normally select whether the comments should be visible to the applicant. 

Where the Reviewer can return the application to the applicant for changes, upon resubmission the Reviewer is prompted by email and task to review the resubmitted application.

Changes made by the applicant are highlighted in green, with deleted text highlighted in red. 

The Reviewer select 'Progress application' to move the application to the next approval stage.
