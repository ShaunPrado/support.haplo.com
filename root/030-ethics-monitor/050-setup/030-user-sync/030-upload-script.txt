long_title: User sync upload script
--

Once you have your control file, you should write an "upload script":https://docs.haplo.org/import/user-sync/upload-script to upload the control file and data. This will make it much easier for you to test.

Every time you make a change to your control file or data, run the script to upload the new data to a test application and run the user sync.

To manage the user sync, including:

* viewing the current status of the sync and logs;
* running the user sync manually if prompted by the response from the server after running the upload script;
* creating API keys;
* viewing the current control file;

navigate to the user sync administration page in Ethics Monitor.
