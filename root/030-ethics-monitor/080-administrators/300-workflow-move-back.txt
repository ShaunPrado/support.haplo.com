title: Moving workflows back
--

At all stages in the approval workflow, Ethics Monitor applications can be returned to the reviewer or applicant by the user listed in the "currently with" box in the status panel.

However, in exceptional cases, users may perform actions in error that cannot be undone by returning the application. In these rare cases, authorised users can override the workflow by moving it back a step.
