h3. Editing the Word document

All the questions in the current ethics application will be included in the generated Word document, as well as the path to its corresponding answer. 
This path will be used to access the applicant's answer to that question. It will also be used in the MERGEFIELD and IF conditions of the template (e.g. MERGEFIELD projectTitle). 
See more guidance about how to create input documents "here":https://docs.haplo.org/plugin/files/transform/generate-fill-fields.
