The most important task for IT at the institution is to provide good quality data:

* Set up the "institution structure":https://docs.haplo.org/app/research/setup/institution-structure

* Set up [node:phd-manager/setup/user-sync:user sync] for the PhD Manager module

* Import any [node:phd-manager/setup/historical-data:historical data], of which only the [node:phd-manager/setup/historical-data/suspensions-and-extensions:suspensions and extensions] is required.

* Resolve any data quality issues
