You will need to write an automated process to upload data files. Usually this will run once a day, and will need to create a scheduled job to generate the data files and run the upload script.

Ideally we would like to test this in a test environment before going live.

The live environment will use a separate hostname and API key to the test environment, so your deployment method should make these configurable.
