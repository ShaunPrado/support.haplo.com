--

The user sync provides daily updates of the details of PhD researchers, supervisors and administrative staff. PhD Manager requires more data than other Haplo Research Manager modules, because it needs details of the PhD research projects as well as the people.

PhD researchers should be included in the feed once they have enrolled. All other users can be included whether or not they are involved in a PhD project.
