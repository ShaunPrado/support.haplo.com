title: Required data
--

Data will typically be sourced from your student records system and HR system. At the very minimum, you need to provide:

* Core user details: Name, Username/ID, Email, Organisational unit
* Category of user: Academic staff, Non-academic staff, Postgraduate Researcher (student)
* Registration/enrolment start date

As it's used to perform regulatory reports, typically the student record system will continue to be the system of record for some key information about the student. Depending on the requirements of your graduate school, you'll probably need to provide:


* Programme of study
* Mode (full time or part time)
* Status (active, suspended, etc)
* Visa type (especially for Tier 4 monitoring)

Your institution may also want to provide:

* REF Unit of Assessment
* Nationality: Home, EU, international
* "ATAS":https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academic-technology-approval-scheme status
* Disability information

The following data is best managed directly in PhD Manager, and we would recommend a one-off import from the current source upon deployment:

* Project supervisors
* Project title
* Scholarship/studentship information

The Haplo team will provide advice during requirements gathering about the best approach for your institution's individual circumstances.

In particular, it is best to avoid syncing dates other than the start date, and use PhD Manager's date rules engine to calculate all project dates.
