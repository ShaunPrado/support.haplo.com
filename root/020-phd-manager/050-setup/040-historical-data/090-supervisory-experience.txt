title: Supervisory experience
--

Information on your current academic supervisor's previous supervision experience is used when putting together new supervisory teams.

This should include experience outside your institution. If you don't have information on supervisory experience at other institutions, you can ask your supervisors to enter it in PhD Manager after the application has gone live.

You can also use this as an alternative to importing [node:phd-manager/setup/historical-data/previous-phd-projects:previous Postgraduate Research projects].

You must make sure this data does not include current PhD researchers appearing in the [node:setup/user-sync/phd-manager] or [node:phd-manager/setup/historical-data/previous-phd-projects:previous Postgraduate Research projects] import.

Please provide a file with records containing the following fields:

* username of supervisor (to match the username in the [node:setup/user-sync/phd-manager])
* Postgraduate Researcher name
* Kind of supervision: @supervisor@, @examiner@, @advisor@, @panel@
* Institution (optional)
* Thesis title (optional)
* Outcome: completed, withdrawn, etc (optional)
* Mode (optional)
* Supervisor's role (optional)
* Start date of project (optional)
* End date of project (optional)

This file may be in any reasonable structure in "JSON, XML or TSV":https://docs.haplo.org/import/control/files#File_formats.


Date fields may be provided in any consistent, machine-readable format.
