title: Other dates
--

You may wish to provide information about key dates for current PhD researchers. This is optional, except in cases where date calculations use previous milestones as an input.

Note that information on [node:phd-manager/setup/historical-data/suspensions-and-extensions] is required for all current PhD Researchers.

Files may be in any reasonable structure in JSON, XML or TSV.

It may be easier to [node:phd-manager/setup/user-sync/one-off-import-from-sync-file:re-use the information gathered for the user sync].


h2. End dates

If your end dates have been calculated in a legacy system, they can be used to verify the new calculated dates. Depending on the requirements, they may be used to make adjustments to the new calculations.

The following information is needed in a single file:

* username of PhD researcher (to match the username in the [node:phd-manager/setup/user-sync])
* end date of project


h2. Historical milestone

If milestones, such as previous annual progress reviews, are available and relevant, they can be provided in a single file with the following fields:

* username of PhD researcher (to match the username in the [node:phd-manager/setup/user-sync])
* kind of milestone
* date of milestone

The milestone 'kind' can be any reasonable description of the milestone, either a code or a human readable name.
