title: Other dates
--

You will need to provide information about key dates for current PhD researchers. The only required date, which is vital for correct calculations, is the project end. Other dates are optional, except in cases where date calculations use previous milestones as an input.

Note that information on [node:phd-manager/setup/historical-data/suspensions-and-extensions] is required for all current PhD Researchers.

Files may be in any reasonable structure in JSON, XML or TSV.

It may be easier to [node:phd-manager/setup/user-sync/one-off-import-from-sync-file:re-use the information gathered for the user sync].


h2. End dates

It is essential to provide end dates as calculated in a legacy system. They will be used to verify newly calculated dates, and to make adjustments to the new calculations where relevant.

The following information is needed in a single file:

* username of PhD researcher (to match the username in the [node:phd-manager/setup/user-sync])
* end date of project

End dates may be provided in any consistent, machine-readable format.


h2. Historical milestone

If milestones, such as previous annual progress reviews, are available and relevant, they can be provided in a single file with the following fields:

* username of PhD researcher (to match the username in the [node:phd-manager/setup/user-sync])
* kind of milestone
* date of milestone

The milestone 'kind' can be any reasonable description of the milestone, either a code or a human readable name.

Milestone dates may be provided in any consistent, machine-readable format.
