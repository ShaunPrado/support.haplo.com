title: Previous PhD projects
--

While not essential, you may wish to import details of previous PhD researchers for historical reporting and to complete the supervision experience of supervisors.

You must make sure that this data does not include any details of current PhD researchers that appear in the [node:phd-manager/setup/user-sync].

It may be easier to provide this information as [node:phd-manager/setup/historical-data/supervisory-experience:your supervisor's supervisory experience].

The following information is required:

* Name of PhD researcher, split into fields: title, first name, last name.
* Thesis title
* Project type (PhD, MRes, etc)
* Outcome (completed, withdrawn)
* Organisational unit
* Supervisor information

For each of the supervisors, provide:

* username of the supervisor
* Name, split into fields: title, first name, last name.
* Organisational unit
* Email address

This information needs to be provided in a "structured format":https://docs.haplo.org/import/control/files#File_formats in a single file. Please discuss formats with your Haplo contact before preparing a data extract.
