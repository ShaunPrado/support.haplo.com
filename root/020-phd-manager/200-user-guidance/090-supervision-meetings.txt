Supervisory meetings can be started by supervisors or postgraduate researchers.

They can be scheduled for the future, which will send an email notification to the participants selected, or recorded after the meeting has taken place.

Meetings can be recorded as:
* In person
* Telephone
* Email
* Video conference

Meeting notes are then added by the postgraduate researcher and supervisor attending the meeting.

The meeting notes are confirmed, or revisions can be requested.

Once the meeting is marked as complete, follow-on notes can be added.

The meeting can also be recorded as not taking place.

Previous supervisory meetings are displayed by academic year and can be downloaded.
