Data can be pushed in or retrieved on an ad-hoc basis. The available options fall into three categories:

* Push data into the system using our "REST API":https://docs.haplo.org/import/rest-api. This is self service and we will guide you in setting it up.

* Poll the application for changes.

* Have the Haplo application output a queue of changes for an administrator to apply manually in the institution's system.

Any such integrations will need to be discussed with the Haplo team in advance in order to determine the feasibility of the integration and determine what work is required.
