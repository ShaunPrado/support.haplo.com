title: Required data
--

Data will typically be sourced from your student records system and HR system.

If any of the below data is provided as a code, the institution will also have to provide Haplo with a mapping that specifies how to interpret the codes. This information can be provided in any format, for example a spreadsheet or a document.

h2. All users

All users must have:

* Name
* Username/ID
* Email
* Organisational unit
* Category of user: Academic staff, Non-academic staff, Postgraduate Researcher (student)

Refer to our "guidance about usernames and email addresses":https://docs.haplo.org/import/user-sync#No_duplicate_usernames to ensure that these are appropriately setup in the provided data. The username or email address will have to match the identifier people will use to authenticate to the system.

Additionally, your institution may wish to provide:

* REF Unit of Assessment
* Nationality: Home, EU, international
* "ATAS":https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academic-technology-approval-scheme status
* Disability information

h2. Students

As well as the required information above, students must have:

* Registration/enrolment start date

As it's used to perform regulatory reports, typically the student record system will continue to be the system of record for some key information about the student. Depending on the requirements of your graduate school, you'll probably need to provide:

* Programme of study
* Mode (full time or part time)
* Status (active, suspended, etc)
* Visa type (especially for Tier 4 monitoring)

The following data is best managed directly in PhD Manager, and we would recommend a one-off import from the current source upon deployment:

* Project supervisors (as usernames)
* Project title
* Scholarship/studentship information

The Haplo team will provide advice during requirements gathering about the best approach for your institution's individual circumstances.

In particular, it is best to avoid syncing dates other than the start date, and use PhD Manager's date rules engine to calculate all project dates.

The data should be provided in one of the "supported file formats":https://docs.haplo.org/import/control/files.
