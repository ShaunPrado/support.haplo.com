title: Required data
--

Data will typically be sourced from your student records system and HR system.

If any of the below data is provided as a code, the institution will also have to provide Haplo with a mapping that specifies how to interpret the codes. This information can be provided in any format, for example a spreadsheet or a document.

h2. All users

All users must have:

* Name (split into title, first and last name fields)
* Username/ID
* Email
* Organisational unit
* Category of user: Academic staff, Non-academic staff, Postgraduate Researcher (student)

Refer to our "guidance about usernames and email addresses":https://docs.haplo.org/import/user-sync#No_duplicate_usernames to ensure that these are appropriately setup in the provided data. The username or email address will have to match the identifier people will use to authenticate to the system.

Additionally, your institution may wish to provide:

* Nationality: Specific nationality, or wider categories such as _Home_ or _International_
* Disability information
* REF Unit of Assessment (for UK institutions only)

[SNIPPET setup/organisational-structure]

h2. Students

As well as the required information above, students must have:

* Registration/enrolment start date

h3. Student records system is system of record

As it's used to perform regulatory reports, typically the student record system will continue to be the system of record for some key information about the student. In this case, any workflows which request changes to this information will not actually make the change in PhD Manager. A manual step, or an integration, will update the student records system. The next time the user sync runs, the field will be updated in PhD Manager.

Depending on the requirements of your graduate school, these fields may include:

* Programme of study
* Mode (full time or part time)
* Status (active, suspended, etc)
* Visa type (especially for Tier 4 monitoring)

h3. PhD Manager is system of record

The following data is best managed directly in PhD Manager, and we would recommend a one-off import from the current source upon deployment:

* Project supervisors (as usernames)
* Project title
* Scholarship/studentship information

Where this data is used for additional processes outside of the scope of your PhD Manager implementation, these fields may be managed in the student records system.

h3. Additional data

This list is not exhaustive. Your institution will probably need additional data to be synchronised to enable implementation of business rules and provide necessary information to your users.

h3. Data design

The Haplo team will provide advice during requirements gathering about the best approach for system of record and integrations for your institution's individual circumstances.

In particular, it is best to avoid syncing dates other than the start date, and use PhD Manager's date rules engine to calculate all project dates.

The data should be provided in one of the "supported file formats":https://docs.haplo.org/import/control/files.


h2. Historical data

In addition to the ongoing user sync, some [node:phd-manager/setup/historical-data:historical data] will need to be provided for one-off import.
