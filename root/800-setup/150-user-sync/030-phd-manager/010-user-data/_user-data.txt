title: Staff and student data
--

Data will typically be sourced from your student records system and HR system.

If any of the below data is provided as a code, the institution will also have to provide Haplo with a mapping that specifies how to interpret the codes. This information can be provided in any format, for example a spreadsheet or a document.

h2. All users

All users must have:

* Name (split into title, first and last name fields)
* Username/ID (see notes below)
* Email
* Organisational unit
* Category of user: Academic staff, Non-academic staff, Postgraduate Researcher (student)

Additionally, your institution may wish to provide:

* Nationality: Specific nationality, or wider categories such as _Home_ or _International_
* Disability information
* REF Unit of Assessment (for UK institutions only)


h2. Usernames

The @username@ of a user must be unique within the data files, so that users can be unambiguously matched. In addition, either the username or email address will have to match the identifier used to [node:setup/authentication:identify users when they log in].

Usernames are opaque to the user sync, and can be any string or identifier. Note that usernames are _case insensitive_, and internally are converted to lower case. The identifiers used as the username must not differ only in case, eg @JSmith@ and @jsmith@ must refer to the same user.

If a record duplicates the @username@ of a previous record, it will be ignored with an error in the logs.

While it's not an enforced constraint, it is advised that email addresses are unique for avoiding ambiguity. This is particularly important for authenticating users through external identity systems that use the email address to identify the authenticated user.


h2. Student project data

As well as the required information above, students must have:

* Registration/enrolment start date
* Programme of study
* Mode (full time or part time)
* Status (active, suspended, etc)

and optionally,

* Visa type (especially for Tier 4 monitoring for UK institutions)
* Project supervisors (as usernames)
* Project title
* Scholarship/studentship information
* Programme of study
* Mode (full time or part time)
* Status (active, suspended, etc)


h3. Additional data

This list is not exhaustive. Your institution will probably need additional data to be synchronised to enable implementation of business rules and provide necessary information to your users.

In addition, the [node:setup/architecture] will determine how data is transferred between systems.


h2. Historical data

As part of the setup process, some historical data will need to be imported.

It is *vital* that information about [node:setup/user-sync/phd-manager/user-data/suspensions-and-extensions:historical suspensions and extensions] and [node:setup/user-sync/phd-manager/user-data/dates:project end dates] for current Postgraduate Researchers are provided, as without this information, the project date calculations will be incorrect.
