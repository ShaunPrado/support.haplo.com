title: Staff and student data
--

Data will typically be sourced from your student records system and HR system.

If any of the below data is provided as a code, the institution will also have to provide Haplo with a mapping that specifies how to interpret the codes. This information can be provided in any format, for example a spreadsheet or a document.

h2. All users

All users must have:

* Name (split into title, first and last name fields)
* Username/ID (see notes below)
* Email
* Organisational unit
* Category of user: Academic staff, Non-academic staff, Postgraduate Researcher (student)

Additionally, your institution may wish to provide:

* Nationality: Specific nationality, or wider categories such as _Home_ or _International_
* Disability information
* REF Unit of Assessment (for UK institutions only)


h2. Usernames

The @username@ of a user must be unique within the data files, so that users can be unambiguously matched. In addition, either the username or email address will have to match the identifier used to [node:setup/authentication:identify users when they log in].

Usernames are opaque to the user sync, and can be any string or identifier. Note that usernames are _case insensitive_, and internally are converted to lower case. The identifiers used as the username must not differ only in case, eg @JSmith@ and @jsmith@ must refer to the same user.

If a record duplicates the @username@ of a previous record, it will be ignored with an error in the logs.

While it's not an enforced constraint, it is advised that email addresses are unique for avoiding ambiguity. This is particularly important for authenticating users through external identity systems that use the email address to identify the authenticated user.


h2. Students

As well as the required information above, students must have:

* Registration/enrolment start date

h3. Student records system is system of record

As it's used to perform regulatory reports, typically the student record system will continue to be the system of record for some key information about the student. In this case, any workflows which request changes to this information will not actually make the change in PhD Manager. A manual step, or an integration, will update the student records system. The next time the user sync runs, the field will be updated in PhD Manager.

Depending on the requirements of your graduate school, these fields may include:

* Programme of study
* Mode (full time or part time)
* Status (active, suspended, etc)
* Visa type (especially for Tier 4 monitoring)

h3. PhD Manager is system of record

The following data is best managed directly in PhD Manager, and we would recommend a one-off import from the current source upon deployment:

* Project supervisors (as usernames)
* Project title
* Scholarship/studentship information

Where this data is used for additional processes outside of the scope of your PhD Manager implementation, these fields may be managed in the student records system.

h3. Additional data

This list is not exhaustive. Your institution will probably need additional data to be synchronised to enable implementation of business rules and provide necessary information to your users.

h3. Data design

The Haplo team will provide advice during requirements gathering about the best approach for system of record and integrations for your institution's individual circumstances.

In particular, it is best to avoid syncing dates other than the start date, and use PhD Manager's date rules engine to calculate all project dates.

The data should be provided in one of the "supported file formats":https://docs.haplo.org/import/control/files.


h2. Historical data

As part of the setup process, some historical data will need to be imported.

It is *vital* that information about [node:setup/user-sync/phd-manager/user-data/suspensions-and-extensions:historical suspensions and extensions] and [node:setup/user-sync/phd-manager/user-data/dates:project end dates] for current Postgraduate Researchers are provided, as without this information, the project date calculations will be incorrect.
