title: Sending initial data files
--

Upload your files to the Project Room using the User sync task, which will have been assigned to your technical lead for the project.

Include:

* initial user data file containing details of staff and students
* organisational structure
* mappings for any codes used in the data files
* verification file (submission deadline)
* one-off historic import  of suspensions, extensions, changes of mode
* one-off historic import of past postgraduate researchers

The Haplo team will then write your initial control file for you to complete.

If any data is not immediately available, please let us know, and send the priority files of the user data, organisational structure and mappings.
