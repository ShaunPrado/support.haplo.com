--

PhD Manager builds on Haplo Research Manager, so you should read the "notes on setting up user sync":https://docs.haplo.org/app/research/setup/user-sync.

PhD Manager adds a @phd:group:doctoral-researchers@ _Managed group_ to set the category of PhD researchers.


h2. Creating a control file

To set up the user sync, you need to write a "control file":https://docs.haplo.org/import/control to map the data you're providing into the right parts of the PhD Manager database.

Depending on your contract, the Haplo team may provide you with an initial version of this control file for you to refine.

To create a new control file, it's best to start with the control file generator.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > Data import > Models > haplo:user-sync > Generate control file...

Select all the fields for the _User account_ destination (@username@, etc), then select the other fields you're going to sync.

This must include <tt>project-start@actual</tt> in the dates section, which is the project start date, and @hres:attribute:research-institute@, the user's organisational unit.

Refer to the model information page for the meaning of these fields.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > Data import > Models > haplo:user-sync

After you have selected the fields, click _Generate control file_ to produce the initial version. Then, referring to the "user sync documentation":https://docs.haplo.org/import/user-sync, set up the input files and adjust the instructions and mappings.

Refer to the [node:setup/user-sync/phd-manager/data-model] documentation for how to use the import data model for PhD Manager.
