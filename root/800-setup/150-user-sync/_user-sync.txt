title: User sync
--

The user sync provides daily updates of the details of researchers and administrative staff. Some applications will also need details of Postgraduate Researchers, and possibly taught students.

The Haplo team will work with you via a secure online Project Room on the implementation of your user sync. 

# We'll ask you to send us an initial data file, your organisational structure, and any mappings via the Project Room.
# The Haplo team will create your initial control file. 
# You'll complete the control file.
# If changes to the feed are identified during the implementation project you may need to repeat the process.

Please refer to the specific documentation for the modules you are using:

[node:setup/user-sync/phd-manager]
[node:setup/user-sync/ethics-monitor]

When you use multiple modules, you will implement a single user feed containing the combined requirements for the modules.

Users may also be managed [node:setup/user-sync/user-api:using APIs].
