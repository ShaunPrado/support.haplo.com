title: User sync
--

The user sync provides daily updates of the details of researchers and administrative staff. Some applications will also need details of PhD researchers, and possibly taught students.

Please refer to the specific documentation for the modules you are using:

[node:setup/user-sync/phd-manager]
[node:setup/user-sync/ethics-monitor]

When you use multiple modules, you will implement a single user feed containing the combined requirements for the modules.

Users may also be managed [node:setup/user-sync/user-api:using APIs].
