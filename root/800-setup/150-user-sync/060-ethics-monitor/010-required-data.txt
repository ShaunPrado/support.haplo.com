Data will typically be sourced from your student records system and HR system. At the very minimum, you need to provide:

* Name - separated into first, middle, and last name fields
* Username/ID - must be unique and not change throughout the person's time at the university
* Email - it is recommended that these are unique for a record
* Organisational unit
* Category of user: Academic staff, Non-academic staff, Postgraduate Researcher (student), Postgraduate Taught Student, Undergraduate Student

The Haplo team will provide advice during requirements gathering about the best approach for your institution's individual circumstances.
