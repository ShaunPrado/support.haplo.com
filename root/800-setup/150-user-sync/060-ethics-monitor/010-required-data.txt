h2. Required data

Data will typically be sourced from your student records system and HR system. At the very minimum, you need to provide:

* Name - separated into first, middle, and last name fields
* Username/ID - must be unique and not change throughout the person's time at the university
* Email - it is recommended that these are unique for a record
* Organisational unit
* Category of user: Academic staff, Non-academic staff, Postgraduate Researcher (student), (and if taught students are submitting ethics applications via Ethics Monitor also include Postgraduate Taught Student, and Undergraduate Student)

h2. Providing the data

Please send initial data files via your [node:setup/project-room]. These should be formatted in JSON or XML. Although we don't recommend it, we can also accept TSV files.

After we have the initial data, we will write the first version of the [node:setup/user-sync/ethics-monitor/control-file:control file], and hand it over to you for fine tuning.
