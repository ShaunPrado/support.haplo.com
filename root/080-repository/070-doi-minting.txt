title: DOI Minting
--

If your institution has DataCite membership, Haplo Repository is able to offer DOI minting from within the repository.

DOIs can be minted for items without an existing DOI, either:

* At the point of deposit of a new item to the public repository

* After deposit, for historical records

in both cases, repository adminstrators are asked to confirm before a DOI minting request is sent to DataCite. 

After the request is sent to DataCite, Haplo Repository will wait for a response that the DOI has been minted successfully, and automatically append the DOI to the record when that response is received.

In order to be able to mint a DOI certain minimum metadata fields are required to be present on the record. If any of these are missing Haplo Repository will inform users that a DOI cannot be minted until it is added.
