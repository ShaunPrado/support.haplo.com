h2. Required data

The key requirement for imported data is that we are able to uniquely match each author at the institution in the imported data to their record in the [node:repository/setup/user-sync]. For this there must be a common identifier for each author between the imported data and user sync data.

Examples of suitable identifiers that may be present in both systems are:

* ORCID iD

* Organisational ID

* Institutional email address


h2. Providing the data

The Haplo team will work with your repository supplier to arrange the best method of data transfer. This is usually in the form of a full data export which can then be uploaded to the Haplo Repository for import.
