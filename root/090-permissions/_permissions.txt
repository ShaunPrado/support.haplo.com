title: Access & Permissions
--

Permissions in Haplo are flexible and fine-grained. 


User permissions are based on the roles a user has in an organisation. Authorised users can add and remove other users from roles. 

The permissions granted to a role are configured by Haplo. Please contact Haplo Support to make changes to the permissions allowed for a role.
