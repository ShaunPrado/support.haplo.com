Haplo sends email notifications to users at various points during a workflow process. These emails are not sent in the test system, enabling you to test without risking emails being sent.

You can view the text of the emails being sent using the Test email viewer. 

* If you're impersonating another user, click 'Finish' on the red banner. 
* Click on your name in the top right. 
* Select, 'Test email viewer' and open in a new tab. 

Any emails that would otherwise be sent by the system during your testing session will display here.
