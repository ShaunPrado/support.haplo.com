h2. Sending files

The Project Room is used to send us files securely. From the home page, click the _Send data file..._ button, upload the file, and click _Save_.

Please *do not* send files by email.


h2. Documents

All documentation, specifications and requirements will be uploaded to the Project room. Click _All documents_ on the left to view the document library.


h2. Form editor

Most of your processes will ask users to complete forms.

We'll set up the forms you need in the Project Room, and then you'll use the form editor in the Project Room to create and edit your forms. Click the _Forms..._ button on the home page.

After you have edited the forms, Haplo will transfer them to your test or live applications after a quick technical check.


h2. Accessing test environments

During the implementation process, we'll provide one or more test environments for your testing. When these are available, you'll be able to log in via the Project Room.

Click _Test applications..._ on the home page, click on the application, then click the _Login..._ button.

After your application has been deployed, your test environment will continue to be available in the Project Room.
